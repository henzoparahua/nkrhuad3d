The wWinMain is the conventional name for the application entry point in a Windows Application. It initializes the app, displays its main window and enters a message retrieval-and-dispatch loop at the top-level control structure for the remainder of the application’s execution. 

This is the heart of a Windows application event-driven architecture. 

It follows the signature:

```c
int WINAPI WinMain(
    HINSTANCE hInstance,
    HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,
    LPSTR lpCmdLine, // (ANSI string)
    int nCmdShow
);
```

```c
int WINAPI wWinMain(
    HINSTANCE hInstance,
    HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,
    LPWSTR lpCmdLine, // (Unicode string)
    int nCmdShow
);
```

- `HISTANCE hInstance`
    
    This is a “handle to an instance” or “handle to a module.”
    
    - It uniquely identifies the executable (`.exe`) file when it’s loaded into memory.
    - Many Windows API functions require this handle, especially when loading resources like icons, cursors, bitmaps, or string tables that are embedded within your executable.
    
    Think of it as your application’s unique ID within the operating system.
    
- `HINSTANCE hPrevInstance`
    
    This is obsolete in modern Windows (32-bit and 64-bit systems) and is always `NULL`.
    
    - It was used in 16-bit Windows to indicate if a previous instance of the application was already running, allowing applications to enforce single-instance behavior.
    - For modern Windows, detecting if another instance exists you’d typically use synchronization objects.
- `LPSTR lpCmdLine / LPWSTR lpCmdLine`
    
    A pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the command-line arguments passed to the application.
    
    - The string does not include the name of the executable itself, and if you need the full command line, including the executable name, you would use functions.
    - `LPSTR` indicates an ANSI (8-bit character) string. For Unicode support (which is generally preferred in modern Windows programming), you would typically use wWinMain with `LPWSTR` or call `GetCommandLineW` and `CommandLineToArrayW` functions to parse Unicode command-line arguments into an `argv`-style array.
- `int nCmdShow`
    
    This integer indicates how the main window of the application should be displayed when it’s the first created.
    
    It has some common values such as:
    
    - `SW_SHOWNORMAL` — Activates and displays the window normally.
    - `SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED` — Activates and displays the window maximized.
    - `SW_SHOWMINIMIZED` — Activates and displays the window minimized.
    - `SW_HIDE` — Hides the window.
    
    You pass this value to the `ShowWindow` function when you make your main window visible.
    

The fundamental difference between `WinMain` and `wWinMain` lies in how they handle text strings, particularly command-line arguments. This distinction is rooted in the broader concept of ANSI vs. Unicode character encodings in Windows programming.

The `w` from `wWinMain` comes from “wide character version”, introduced for native Unicode (16-bit, UTF-16) support. It is highly preferred for all modern Windows applications to use `wWinMain` function, because Windows itself is a Unicode-based operating system since Windows NT. All internal string handling and file system operations use Unicode.
